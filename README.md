January's entry into the 1 Game Per Month Challenge.

This game is a modernization of my old LCD style game Elevator Madness.

Rules
=====
You are the bell boy of a stressful 4 story office building and the elevator's control circuitry is fried.

It is now your job to operate the lefts manually by pulling levels and pressing buttons behind the scenes.

The occupants of the building are getting restless. If you leave two people together long enough, they will start a fight.
This is a strike on your record. Three strikes and you are fired.

To open the door, you must move to the correct control panel and press the *Y* button.

To move the elevator up or down, you walk to *any* control panel and press *X* or *A*. Be aware, the elevator
has no safeties and can crash into the roof or the ground. If the elevator has crashed, maintenance must be called, resulting
in a strike on your record

Also, if an occupant ends up on the wrong floor, he will no doubt complain. This is another strike on your record.
